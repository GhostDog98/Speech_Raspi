# Speech_Raspi
This program, originally made for an assignment, designed to run on a raspberry pi (specifically tested on the 3b+) automatically recognises speech using vosk then displays this on an i2c 16*2 screen. 

Given time constraints of the assignment, I was unable to flesh out the posibility of a wireless microphone, due to both implementation details for bluetooth, as well as lack of parts for a transmitter and receiver if RF was decided upon.
